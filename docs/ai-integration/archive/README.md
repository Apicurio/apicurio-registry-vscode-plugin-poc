# AI Integration Archive

Historical debugging and development documentation for AI/MCP integration.

## Purpose

This archive preserves the complete history of:
- MCP server debugging sessions
- Bug reports and investigations
- Development iterations
- Troubleshooting attempts
- Solution evolution

## Why We Keep This

This project embraces **open-source transparency**:
- **Learning Resource** - See how we debugged complex issues
- **Problem-Solving Examples** - Real-world troubleshooting
- **Development Process** - Understand our iterations
- **Bug Investigation** - Complete context for resolved issues

## Contents

This folder contains historical documents including:
- Debugging session logs
- Bug reports (resolved)
- MCP server investigation notes
- Integration testing results
- Issue analysis and solutions

## Not a Graveyard

These documents aren't "dead" - they're **educational resources** showing:
- How we approach debugging
- Iterative problem-solving
- Communication with upstream projects
- Test-driven troubleshooting

## Current Documentation

For active AI integration documentation, see:
- [AI Integration Overview](../README.md) - Current features and setup
- [Architecture](../architecture.md) - MCP architecture design
- [Debugging Guide](../debugging/README.md) - Active debugging resources
- [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) - User setup guide

## Contributing

When debugging AI integration issues:
1. Start with [Debugging Guide](../debugging/README.md)
2. Check this archive for similar past issues
3. Document new issues in debugging/
4. Archive resolved issues here when superseded
