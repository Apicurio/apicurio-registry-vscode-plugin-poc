# Archive

Historical and outdated documentation for the Apicurio Registry VSCode Extension.

## Purpose

This folder contains documentation that is no longer current but preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding past decisions
- Learning from previous approaches
- Audit trail

## Contents

- `CODE_AUDIT_TASK008.md` - Code audit from early development *(if exists)*
- Other outdated planning and analysis documents

## When to Archive

Documents should be moved here when they:
- Are superseded by newer documents
- Contain outdated technical information
- Reference deprecated features or approaches
- Are no longer relevant to current development

Documents should NOT be archived if they:
- Contain current architectural decisions
- Document completed but active features
- Provide valuable reference for contributors

## Active Documentation

- [User Guide](../users/README.md) - End-user documentation
- [Contributor Guide](../contributors/README.md) - Developer documentation
- [Project Planning](../project/README.md) - Current tasks and roadmap
