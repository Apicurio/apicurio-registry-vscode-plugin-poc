# Task Documentation Structure

This directory contains detailed specifications for all UX improvement tasks.

## Organization

Tasks are organized by **status** and **priority**:

```
tasks/
├── completed/           # ✅ Implemented and tested
│   ├── 001-search-command.md
│   └── 002-create-artifact.md
│
├── in-progress/         # 🚧 Currently being worked on
│   └── (empty)
│
└── todo/                # 📋 Planned but not started
    ├── high-priority/   # 🔴 Critical features
    │   └── 003-context-menus.md
    │
    ├── medium-priority/ # 🟡 Important enhancements
    │   ├── 004-add-version.md
    │   ├── 005-custom-svg-icons.md
    │   ├── 006-user-preferences.md
    │   └── 007-delete-operations.md
    │
    └── low-priority/    # 🟢 Nice to have / Deferred
        ├── 008-details-panel.md
        ├── 009-reverse-version-order.md
        └── 010-edit-metadata.md
```

## Quick Access

**Main tracking file:** [`../TODO.md`](../TODO.md)

The TODO.md file provides:
- Quick overview table of all tasks
- Progress summary by priority
- Sprint planning
- Links to detailed task specifications

## Task File Format

Each task file contains:

1. **Header** - Status, priority, effort estimate
2. **Description** - What needs to be done
3. **Motivation** - Why it's needed
4. **Implementation Plan** - How to build it
5. **Testing Plan** - How to verify it works
6. **Reference** - Links to reference plugin and docs
7. **Success Criteria** - When it's considered complete

## Workflow

### Starting a New Task

1. Read the task detail file in `todo/[priority]/`
2. Move to `in-progress/` when you start work
3. Update status in `../TODO.md`

### Completing a Task

1. Implement according to specification
2. Complete testing checklist
3. Move file to `completed/`
4. Update status and stats in `../TODO.md`

### Adding a New Task

1. Create new file with next sequential number
2. Place in appropriate priority folder
3. Add entry to `../TODO.md`
4. Follow standard task file format

## File Naming Convention

`{ID}-{short-name}.md`

- **ID**: 3-digit sequential number (001, 002, etc.)
- **short-name**: Kebab-case description (search-command, add-version)

## Priority Definitions

- 🔴 **High Priority** - Critical missing features that block basic workflows
- 🟡 **Medium Priority** - Important enhancements that improve UX
- 🟢 **Low Priority** - Nice to have features, polish, or deferred to later phases

## Status Definitions

- ✅ **Completed** - Feature implemented, tested, and documented
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- 📋 **Todo** - Planned but not started
- ⏸️ **Deferred** - Low priority, postponed to later phase
